A prototype for the implementation of a sensing delay resilient spectrum sharing system

# Overview

The work is published in Sep. 2017. NTU, Taiwan.

This prototype can operate in both simulation and USRP real-time transmission

Current version only support LINUX environment.

For reference, we develop the prototype in ubunut 16.04 operating system.

# Concept

All devices operated at the same frequency band, the secondary users' (SU) interference to primary users' (PU) is subtracted once been sensed.
